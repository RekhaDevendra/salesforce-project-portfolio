## Objective:

This solution automated data enrichment, improved lead management, and ensured 100% SLA compliance for lead processing, directly improving sales efficiency.

## Tools Used:
- **Salesforce CRM**: Central platform for managing and automating lead data.
- **ZoomInfo**: External data source for enriching lead profiles with job titles, company size, and industry.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For conducting monthly data audits and exporting lead data.
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: To identify and enrich leads with additional contact details and company info.
- **Salesforce Validation Rules**: Ensuring data integrity (e.g., ensuring email and phone fields are not empty).
- **Salesforce Reports & Dashboards**: To track SLA compliance, visualize lead progress, and monitor team performance.

## Steps Taken:

### 1. Lead Data Enrichment Workflow Setup
Identified data gaps in incoming leads, which were sourced from **LinkedIn** and **ZoomInfo**. 

**Action Steps:**
- Developed a consistent process for enriching the incoming leads by verifying the following fields:
  - **Email** and **Phone**
  - **Job Titles**, **Company Size**, **Location**
  - **Industry Vertical** (using custom fields)
  
### 2. Salesforce Customization
To better capture and track lead enrichment and SLA metrics, we customized Salesforce:

**Custom Fields Created:**
- **Lead Source Details** (e.g., LinkedIn, ZoomInfo)
- **Contact Verification Status** (to track whether email, phone, and other fields were validated)
- **SLA Timestamps** (to capture timestamps for lead receipt and processing completion)

**Salesforce Validation Rule Example**:
```plaintext
Rule: Ensure Email and Phone are Not Blank
Formula:
ISBLANK(Email) || ISBLANK(Phone)
Error Message: "Email and Phone fields are required."
