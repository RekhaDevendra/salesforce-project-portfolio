This portfolio showcases a variety of Salesforce projects I've built to solve real-world business problems, automate workflows, and enhance data visibility for sales and marketing teams.

Each project in this repository reflects a practical use case â€” from lead segmentation and SLA tracking to workflow automation, role-based access, and custom reporting. These are the kinds of solutions Iâ€™ve designed to streamline operations and drive informed decision-making in fast-paced business environments.
